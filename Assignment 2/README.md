## Description of the Problems
---
1. This problem deals with the modelling of the number of goals scored by a team. We try to model it with a known distribution and then try with the availabble of the shelf models and deduce which is the most effective.

2. This problem deals with the simulation study to understand sampling distributions. We use variuos R functions and build some of our own and use different visualization tools to present it.

3. This problem deals with the inbuilt dataset in R, where we try to calculate the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) for each given model. Then we try to find a probability using the best model.

4. This problem deals with the modelling of insurance claims. We use variuos statistical techniques to find the BIC of 4 different models.

5. This problem deals with the modelling of stock prices. Given a model, we try to estimate variuos parameters using MOM (Method of Moments), and answer a few stock related questions.
